# The Newsweek Homepage

![screenshot](./Screenshot.png)

## Project Description
This project required that we replicate [The Newsweek Homepage](https://www.newsweek.com/) using a css grid framework. I used boostrap to create this project in its responsive nature. I also exploited some of the utility classes just to make all elements appear well on the homepage throughout all the screen viewports.

## How it was Implemented

I considered creating the desktop view first then continued to make it responsive with smaller and bigger screen sizes using the .col-md-*, .col-sm-* and .col-lg-* bootstrap classes.
Since it is a framework, these classes are already defined in the boostrap.css minified file.
